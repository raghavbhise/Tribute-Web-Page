        <h1>Achievements of Lokmanya Tilak:<br> A Champion of Swaraj and Mass Awakening</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p> Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a name synonymous with courage, patriotism, and unwavering dedication to India's freedom, 
                left an indelible mark on the nation's struggle for independence. His contributions spanned various domains, 
                from journalism and education to social reform and political mobilization. Tilak's achievements resonate even today, 
                inspiring generations with his indomitable spirit and his clarion call for Swaraj (self-rule).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Journalism and National Awakening</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
            <img src="newspaper.jpg" alt="Tilak's Newspaper"></div>
            <p>Tilak's journalistic endeavors played a pivotal role in awakening the national consciousness. In 1881, he co-founded the 
                newspapers Kesari (in Marathi) and Mahratta (in English), which became powerful instruments for disseminating nationalist 
                ideas and mobilizing public opinion against British rule. Kesari, in particular, with its fiery and evocative language, 
                became a mouthpiece for Tilak's nationalist views, reaching a wide audience and igniting a spark of patriotism in the 
                hearts of countless Indians.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Education as a Tool for Empowerment:</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
            <img src="fergusson college.jpg" alt="Fergusson College"></div>
            <p>Tilak firmly believed that education was the key to empowering the masses and liberating the nation. In 1884, he co-founded
                the Deccan Education Society, which aimed to promote nationalist education and instill a sense of pride in Indian culture
                and heritage among the youth. The Deccan Education Society established several educational institutions, including
                Fergusson College in Pune, which became a leading center for nationalist thought and activism. Tilak himself taught
                mathematics at Fergusson College for a brief period, further emphasizing his commitment to education.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Championing Swaraj:</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
            <img src="slogan.jpg" alt="Tilak's Swaraj Slogan"></div>
            <p>Tilak's most significant contribution was his unwavering advocacy for Swaraj. He was the first leader to demand complete 
                independence from British rule, famously declaring, "Swaraj is my birthright, and I shall have it!" This clarion call 
                resonated with millions of Indians and became a rallying cry for the independence movement. Tilak's relentless pursuit 
                of Swaraj, even in the face of imprisonment and persecution, inspired generations of freedom fighters and laid the 
                foundation for India's eventual independence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Uniting the Masses:</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Ganesh Visarjan.jpg" alt="Ganesh Visarjan Celebration"></div>
            <p>Tilak understood the importance of uniting the masses in the struggle for independence. He skillfully used religious and 
                cultural symbols to bring people together and foster a sense of national identity. He revived the celebration of Ganesh 
                Chaturthi, transforming it from a private family affair into a large-scale public festival that served as a platform for 
                nationalist gatherings and speeches. He also promoted the celebration of Shivaji Jayanti, commemorating the Maratha warrior 
                king Shivaji Maharaj, as a symbol of resistance against foreign rule.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>A Leader of the Nationalist Movement:</h2>
            <div class="image-container">
            <img src="nationalist leaders.jpg" alt="Nationalist Leaders"></div>
            <p>Tilak was a prominent leader of the nationalist movement, playing a crucial role in shaping its ideology and direction. 
                He was a strong advocate of assertive nationalism, believing that the time for petitioning the British government was over 
                and that more forceful methods were needed to achieve independence. He was part of the Lal-Bal-Pal trio (Lala Lajpat Rai, 
                Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Bipin Chandra Pal), which championed a more radical approach to the freedom struggle.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Lucknow Pact.jpg" alt="Lucknow Pact"></div>
            <p>Tilak's political acumen was evident in his role in the Lucknow Pact of 1916. This landmark agreement between the 
                Indian National Congress and the Muslim League sought to forge Hindu-Muslim unity in the fight against British rule. 
                The Lucknow Pact was a significant step towards bringing together diverse communities in the common cause of independence.

                ideas and ideals remain relevant even today. Tilak's life serves as a testament to the power of courage, conviction, and 
                unwavering dedication to a noble cause. He will forever be etched in the annals of Indian history as a true patriot and 
                a maker of modern India.</p>
